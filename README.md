# vosk_record

This is a demo based on [record](https://github.com/llfbandit/record/tree/master/record) and [vosk](https://github.com/alphacep/vosk-flutter) packages to display that you can record audio and run Vosk STT at the same time.


[Here is a video of running it](https://github.com/agladyshev/vosk-with-record/assets/9337778/fb77f9b6-16bd-4f2c-a9a0-05add54cadbb)
